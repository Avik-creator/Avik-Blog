**MERN Full Stack Blog Project**

This project is a full-fledged blog application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) with a focus on robust backend architecture and user experience. While the frontend might have some minor visual imperfections, the backend implementation is thoroughly secure and encompasses essential functionalities.

**Key Features:**

* **Secure and Scalable Backend:**
    * Robust Mongoose models for data persistence in MongoDB.
    * Optimized for performance and scalability.
    * Implemented best practices for security, including proper sanitization and input validation.
    * JWT-based user authentication and authorization for secure access control.
    * Password hashing with a strong, industry-standard algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
    * Regular security audits and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities.
* **Enhanced User Experience:**
    * Seamless sign in and sign up with Google authentication.
    * Streamlined user profile management (picture, username, email).
    * Responsive design for optimal viewing across devices.
    * Light and dark mode themes to personalize user preferences.
    * Blog post creation with image upload and category selection.
    * Commenting system for user interaction and engagement.
    * Pagination for efficient navigation through blog posts.
    * Search functionality to locate posts by title.
    * **Added Security Feature:** OTP (One-Time Password) verification during signup for additional login security.
* **Deployment and Learning Resources:**
